# Score Cluster

## Funding
This cluster was purchased in 2019 from CCM budget. 
## Purpose
The Score cluster is suitable for long-running single-core jobs.
## Hardware

5 nodes Dell R720, each Dual E5-2670v2s (2.5Ghz 10 cores each), 192GB DDR3 RAM, total 100 cores and 960GB memory.
  Ethernet interconnect 10Gbit.

## Software
Jobs for the Score cluster nodes can be submitted using the [scheduler on clas-compute](../clusters_guide).

## How to Use
The Score cluster does not have a head node. 
Batch jobs for nodes 3-5 should be submitted on the [common scheduler](../clusters guide). Nodes 1 and 2 are on the [legacy scheduler](http://ccm.ucdenver.edu/wiki/2019_Cluster_Instructions).
