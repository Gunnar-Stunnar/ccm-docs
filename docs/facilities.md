# Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources

## Computing Facilities 
The Center for Computational Mathematics (CCM) and the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver operate a network of clusters and servers which includes:

*   [Alderaan cluster](../alderaan/), total 2240 AMD 7502 cores and 4 NVIDIA A-100 GPUs: 2048 AMD 7502 cores and 16TB memory in 32 compute nodes (64 cores and 512GB per node), each with dual 960GB SSDs; 2 high-memory GPU nodes each with two NVIDIA A100 GPU, 2TB memory, and 64 AMD 7502 cores, and 960GB SSDs; head node with 64 cores; 816TB storage (1PB raw), HDR100 Infiniband interconnect, and 10Gb/s connectivity from every node to Internet 2.
*   [Colibri cluster](../colibri/), 384 Intel Sandy Bridge cores, 48 NVidia Tesla M2090 Fermi GPUs, QDR Infiniband interconnect, 104TB disk array, High Memory Interactive Node with 32 cores, and 1TB memory.
*   [Score cluster](../score/), 100 Intel Ivy Bridge cores, 5 nodes, 192GB memory per node, 10Gbit Ethernet interconnects.
*   [Jupyterhub server](../jupyterhub/), 36 Intel E5-2695 v4  cores, 384GB memory, RAID with two 480 GB SSDs, dedicated for classroom use and student research.
*   [190TB storage array](../storage/).
*   Network of workstations and servers, connected by 1Gbs Ethernet, with 10Gbs uplink to the campus backbone.

## Software
*   The network uses a common SLURM batch scheduler, integrated with clusters from other department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (chemistry, biology).
*   Installed software on the computing network includes MATLAB, R, and GNU compilers. Additional software can be installed on request. 
*   A large collection of software is available to CU Denver students and faculty through the Office of Information for free or at reduced costs, including a MATLAB site license.

## Personnel Resources

* The system admnistration is managed by the CCM Director and backed by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences IT group. 

## Other Resources
* CU Denver is member of the the [Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium](https://rmacc.org) (RMACC). The RMACC [Summit cluster](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/resources/summit) has 10,800 Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3 2.50GHz cores in compute nodes and 20 NVidia Tesla K80 GPUs. The Summit cluser is accessible through XSEDE, and allocations are available to CU Denver students and faculty from the RMACC 10% share.

* The CU Denver|Anschutz [Office of Information Technology](https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology) (OIT) is operating a HIPAA-compliant HPC facility [Rosalind](https://www.ucdenver.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology/ticr-high-performance-computing) with 768 cores at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine on the CU Anschutz campus, and HIPAA-compliant Google Cloud facility, both for a fee. Their cost can be charged to sponsored projects.
