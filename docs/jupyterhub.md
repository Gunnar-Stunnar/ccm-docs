# JupyterHub

JupyterHub provides a graphical interface from a web browser. You need to be on then internal network,
or VPN, or connecting from [VMWare Horizon](https://remote.ucdenver.edu) (Click on *Complimentary* to get a desktop.)
Then, go to

  https://math-alderaan 

or, if the short name does not work, the full name

  https://math-alderaan.ucdenver.pvt

click away the warnings, and log in with your University username and password. Then click on the *New Server* button. After a short
time, you should see the JupyterLab screen. Your session will run somewhere on Alderaan on a dedicated CPU and 4GB of memoty..

To access files and directories outside of your home directory, you can make soft links to them from a terminal amd then click on it
in the file tree.

JuputerHub is a new **experimental** addition to Alderaan. We do not support yet many common features.

**Sesions may be inrerrupted** as the JupyterHub server is restarted when we work on it, so **please save your
work frequently.** 

Please write Alderaan Help from CU Denver email if you have any suggestioms or requests.
