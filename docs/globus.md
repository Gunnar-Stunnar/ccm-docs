# Globus File Transfer

[Globus](https://www.globus.org) is a standard free open-source software for robust transfer of large amounts without having to monitor the connection, and can work transparently through firewalls. Globus is also convenient [service from the University of Chicago](https://www.globus.org/our-story), which provides access to a network of computers running the Globus software, free for personal use in the US academia.

## Globus basics

Globus data transfer runs between two software installations, called [endpoints](https://docs.globus.org/faq/globus-connect-endpoints). The transfer is initiated and can be monitored from a web interface. There are two kinds of endpoints, ''Server'' and ''Personal''. A subscription is required to run a Server endpoint or for transfer between two Personal endpoints. Without a subscription, at least one of the endpoints needs to be a Server endpoint. 

## How to connect to Globus

CU Denver does not have Globus subscription and thus we do not have any Server endpoints. But you can install Globus Personal endpoint in your account on our Linux servers or your PC and transfer data to and from any Server endpoint you are allowed to log into.

* Log into your account on the `math-alderaan` or `clas-compute, and install the endpoint from command line, following the [instructions](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux) from Globus with a grain of salt:

    `mkdir globus`
    `cd globus`
    `wget  https://downloads.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/linux/stable/globusconnectpersonal-latest.tgz`
    `tar xvfz globusconnectpersonal-latest.tgz`
    `cd globusconnectpersonal-x.y.z`  # replace x.y.z by the version from the downloaded file
    `./globusconnectpersonal -setup`

After a little while, you should get a link. Copy and paste the link to your browser and log in with your CU Denver credentials. The Globus website should give you a temporary access code, copy and paste it after `Enter the auth code:` and press enter. The setup should ask for an endpoint name, make it something you can find easily, such as `math-alderaan-`your-name. Your email address will be visible to anyone on Globus who searches for an endpoint anyway. 
    
* Run the endpoint:

    `screen -S globus`
    `./globusconnectpersonal -start`

* Kill the terminal window or detach from the terminal session by Ctrl-A d. Your endpoint now runs in a virtual terminal until system reboot. You can reconnect to the virtual terminal if you need to by `screen -r globus`.

* Log into [Globus](https://globus.org) again and search for your personal endpoint in the Collections box. Click on the your endpoint name, and you should see the files in your home directory! You can now transfer data between this endpoint and any Server endpoint you can log into.

* Optional: Make a Personal endpoint on your computer the same way following [instructions](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal). You can now transfer data between any Server endpoint and your computer.

# Security notes

* Your personal endpoint runs as you and, in principle, it has access to any files on the computer that you have. 
* A personal endpoint seems to refuse access to some files outside of your home directory, even if they are owned by you.
* Your personal endpoint is visible to anyone on Globus but it is accessible from your own Globus account only.

# Works with
This guide was tested in the following environments. It should work in other cases too.

* 2023-04-21 math-alderaan Centos 8

# Some Globus Server endpoints

* RMACC Alpine at CU Boulder - use `CU Boulder Research Computing ACCESS` endpoint, choose link identity `ACCESS CI`
* NCAR - use `NCAR Data Sharing Service` endpoint
