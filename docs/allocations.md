# Accounts and Allocations
## Eligibility
Faculty and students with `ucdenver.edu` or `cuanschutz.edu` login. Please request an account first, your directory needs to be created before you can log in successfully.
## Process
Account and allocation requests should be sent to jan.mandel@ucdenver.edu. If you need more than the default core or storage resources below, your allocation request should include:

* a brief description of the project (title and few sentences),
* funding source, if any, with an agency, grant number, and title 
* a brief justification of the resources requested, such as the aticipated number of runs, the number of cores and time per run, the total size of files generated per run, and the total size of external data the user will bring in.

## Resources and Allocations
**To encourage early use, storage and core time limits below are currently soft and may be extended as needed - we want you to work here**! They will firm up in future as needed to keep the resources available fairly for everyone.

### Storage 
**Users are responsible for maintaining copies of their important files elsewhere. Files can be lost, even with backups.** 
 
* **Home directories** â€“ 25GB, more with an allocation request. Backed up weekly, keeping 4 backups from various times. Home directories are `/home/user`, usually implemented as soft links. 
* **Project storage** -  250GB, more with an allocation request. **Not backed up.** Project directories are in  `/storage/department/projects/name`, often implemented as soft links. 
* **Scratch** - no limit, not backed up. Files with oldest access date will be purged automatically when the scratch space usage is over 80%. Please make your own subdirectories in `/scratch`.

### Cores
* **Small** - up to 30,000 Alderaan core hours, max 128 concurrent cores per user, standard storage. Automatic with an account.
* **Medium** - up to 150,000 Alderaan core hours, max 640 concurrent cores, additional storage. Reviewed monthly
* **Large** - more than medium, reviewed quarterly. 

Jobs are charged for the total reserved core time, whether used or not. 
Jobs on Alderaan GPU/high memory nodes are charged for all 64 cores on the node. 

Core time on other clusters than Alderaan is not limited.
### Transitional

Existing home directories under 25GB are being migrated to backed-up space. **Existing home directories larger than 25GB are not backed up**. Users should bring their home directories under the limit so that they can be migrated to backed-up space. 

Existing projects get initial storage allocation equal to the current use + 10% + the standard project quota. 

## Old files
 
Upon project or user inactivation, the files will be deleted after a notification (if the user's university email still works) and a grace period.
