# Accounts and Allocations
## Eligibility
Employees and students with `ucdenver.edu` or `cuanschutz.edu` login credentials.
## Process
Please use [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/GQ9ef7ei4i) for account and allocation requests. Requests should include:

* a brief description of the project (title and a sentence or few),
* funding source, if any, with an agency, grant number, and title,
* the usernames of users who participate in the project.

If you need more than the default core or storage resources below, your request should contain a brief justification of the resources needed, such as the aticipated number of runs, the number of cores and time per run, the total size of files generated per run, and the total size of external data you will bring in.

## Resources and Allocations
**To encourage early use, storage and core time limits are not enforced for an initial period - we want you to work here**! They will be activated in future as needed to keep the resources available fairly for everyone.

### Storage 
**Users are responsible for maintaining copies of their important files elsewhere. Files can be lost, even with backups.** 
 
* **Home directories** – 25GB, more with an allocation request. Backed up weekly, keeping 4 backups from various times. Home directories are `/home/user`, usually implemented as soft links. 
* **Project storage** -  250GB, more with an allocation request. **Not backed up.** Project directories are in  `/storage/department/projects/name`, often implemented as soft links. A project directory can be shared between a group of users.
* **Scratch** - no limit, not backed up. Files with oldest access date will be purged automatically when the scratch space usage is over 80%. Please make your own subdirectories in `/scratch`.

### Cores
* **Small** - up to 30,000 Alderaan core hours, max 128 concurrent cores per user, standard storage. Automatic with an account.
* **Medium** - up to 150,000 Alderaan core hours, max 640 concurrent cores, additional storage.
* **Large** - larger than medium. 

Jobs are charged for the total reserved core time, whether used or not. 
Jobs on Alderaan GPU/high memory nodes are charged for all 64 cores on the node. 

Core time on other clusters than Alderaan is not limited.
### Transitional

Existing home directories under 25GB are being migrated to backed-up space. **Existing home directories larger than 25GB are not backed up**. Users should bring their home directories under the limit so that they can be migrated to backed-up space. 

Existing projects get initial storage allocation equal to the current use + 10% + the standard project quota. 

## Old files
 
Upon project or user inactivation, the files will be deleted after a notification (if the user's university email still works) and a grace period.
