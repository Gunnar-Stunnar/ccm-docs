### Registration

Please register [here](https://forms.office.com/r/0FN7UbtgCn). Optional for existing users, but **we need to hear in advance from those who do not have their account set up yet, or maybe used to have but can't log in for some reason.** We can set up temporary accounts for participants who register at least one day in advance, but we won't have enough time to set up or fix accounts during the workshop. Faculty can also [request a regular account](../accounts) for themselves or their students.
