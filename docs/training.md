Please register here [coming soon].  **We particularly need to hear in advance from those who do not have an account on alderaan or math-compute set up yet, or can't log in for some reason.** We can set up a temporary account good for a week if you register at least one day in advance, but we won't have enough time to set up or fix accounts during the workshop. Please have your faculty research advisor [request a full permanent account](../accounts) if you need one.
