# Colibri Cluster

## Funding
This cluster was funded by NSF grant [GPU Cluster for Computing Research](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0958354).
## Hardware
The cluster consists of 24 compute nodes each equipped with two Intel CPUs with 16 cores each and two [Fermi](http://www.nvidia.com/object/fermi_architecture.html NVIDIA Fermi) GPUs, connected by InfiniBand. Please see the [legacy Colibri page](http://math.ucdenver.edu/colibri) for more details on the hardware. It was delivered by HP in 2013. 
## Software
In 2014, the HP license on software run out and the cluster was reinstalled with Rocks+ by StackIQ. As of late 2021, the head node and nodes 1-12 are running the now legacy Rocks+ cluster system, and the [original documentation](http://ccm.ucdenver.edu/wiki/Category:Colibri_cluster) still applies to them. 
## How to Use
The legacy head node is accessed by ssh to colibri.ucdenver.pvt.
Nodes 13-24 are accessed through the [common cluster scheduler](../clusters_guide).
