# Colibri cluster

## Funding
This cluster was funded by NSF grant [GPU Cluster for Computing Research](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0958354).
## Hardware
The cluster consists of 24 compute nodes each equipped with two CPUs with 16 cores each and two [http://www.nvidia.com/object/fermi_architecture.html NVIDIA Fermi] GPUs, connected by {{wp|Infiniband}}. Please see the [http://math.ucdenver.edu/colibri legacy cluster page] for more details on the hardware. It was delivered by HP in 2013. 
## Software
In 2014, the HP license on software run out and the cluster was reinstalled with Rocks+ by StackIQ. As of late 2021, the head node and some of the nodes is still running the legacy Rocks+ cluster system, and the [original documentation](http://ccm.ucdenver.edu/wiki/Category:Colibri_cluster) still applies to them. The rest of the nodes was migrated to the [current cluster scheduler](../clusters_guide).
