# How to edit

Please submit a pull request to CCM:

1. Fork [the Github repository](https://github.com/ccmucdenver/ccm-docs) (the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository screen).
2. Clone your fork on your computer (green button "Code" in your forked repository).
3. Make a new branch off the main branch.
4. [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on github asking to merge your new branch into main. 
5. Make your changes following the MkDocs [Getting Started](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started) instructions how to build and preview the site on your computer, and [Writing your docs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs) how to edit the pages.
6. Commit and push your changes to your pull request branch. It is OK to do that frequently.
7. When you are done, 
    * merge the current main branch from the [Github repository](https://github.com/ccmucdenver/ccm-docs) into your pull request branch in your forked repository,
    * resolve any merge conflicts and commit and push.
    * preview and check around all places you changed that nothing went wrong, 
    * repeat as needed until all looks to your satisfaction.
8. Let @janmandel know by a pull request comment that your pull request is ready to be merged.
