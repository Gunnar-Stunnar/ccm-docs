# Local network

## Funding
The equipment is funded by the Department of the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences and the CCM, and
 internal grants from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Network connectivity is provided by the campus, but we have to pay for 
any new network connections.
## Purpose
The network is mostly for interactive use. The network is behind the campus firewall and not accessible from the 
outside except through the VPN.
## Hardware
The network consists of workstations and printers on the 4th floor.
The individual devices have 1Gbs ethernet connection to a switch with 10Gbs uplink to the campus backcbone.


## Software
The workstations run various versions of Linux.
