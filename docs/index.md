and [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on github asking to merge your new branch into main. 
Follow the 
MkDocs [Getting Started](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started) instructions
how to build and preview the site on your computer, and [Writing your docs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs) how to edit the pages.
When you are done, merge the current main branch from this [git repository](https://github.com/ccmucdenver/ccm-docs) into your pull request branch, make sure all looks to your satisfaction, and let @janmandel know by a pull request comment that your pull request is ready.
