# Accounts and Allocations
## Eligibility
Employees and students with `ucdenver.edu` or `cuanschutz.edu` login credentials. 
External collaborators sponsored by a faculty member.

## How to get an account

Please use [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/GQ9ef7ei4i) to request accounts and allocations requests. **The form should be filled by a faculty member and list users in their group, such as students or external collaborators.** External collaborators need a POI (a type of affiliate appointment) with VPN access first.

The form will ask for the **CU Denver email addresses** for all accounts to be created, and

* a brief description of the project (few words is OK),
* funding source, if any,
* a promise include an acknowledgement of the NSF grant 2019089 in all publications and presentations, and send us at least the citation.

This is needed for reporting to the funding agency (annual reports, quad charts, PI meetings, etc.)

## Resources and Allocations
**To encourage early use, storage and core time limits are not enforced for an initial period - we want you to work here! Home directories over** They will be activated in future as needed to keep the resources available fairly for everyone.

### Storage 
**Users are responsible for maintaining copies of their important files elsewhere. Files can be lost, even with backups.
 
* **Home directories** â€“ 25GB. Home directories are `/home/user`, implemented as soft links into disk partitions for each department. Home directories up to 2GB are backed up occasionally. **Home directories over 25GB are not backed up.** 
* **Project storage** -  250GB. **Not backed up.** Project directories are in  `/storage/department/projects/name`, often implemented as soft links. We can make project directories which can be shared between a group of users.
* **Scratch** - no limit, not backed up. Files with oldest access date will be purged automatically when the scratch space usage is over 80%. Please make your own subdirectories in `/scratch`.

Use the command `du -sh` in a directory to see how much space you are using. Home directories and most project directories are on a storage which is using space very effieciently, so the space used can be much less than the actual size of your files as reported by `ls -l`.

### Cores
* **Small** - up to 30,000 Alderaan core hours, max 128 concurrent cores per user, standard storage. Automatic with an account.
* **Medium** - up to 150,000 Alderaan core hours, max 640 concurrent cores, additional storage.
* **Large** - larger than medium. 

Jobs are charged for the total reserved core time, whether used or not. 
Jobs on Alderaan GPU/high memory nodes are charged for all 64 cores on the node. 

Core time on other clusters than Alderaan is not limited.
### Transitional

Existing home directories under 25GB are being migrated to backed-up space. **Existing home directories larger than 25GB are not backed up**. Users should bring their home directories under the limit so that they can be migrated to backed-up space. 

Existing projects get initial storage allocation equal to the current use + 10% + the standard project quota. 

## Old files
 
Upon project or user inactivation, the files will be deleted after a notification (if the user's university email still works) and a grace period.
